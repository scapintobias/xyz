				I was born in the Venice’ countryside, in a family of carpenters, architects
				and designers. And that has been a strong starting point. When I was
				sophomore in high school, I met Maurizio and Armando Milani, fellow
				designers of Massimo Vignelli, who had at hand a rebrand to do, for the
				cultural centre not far from the art school I was attending, so they set up
				a workshop, with the purpose for the students to deliver the corporate
				image. I think that's actually when I found out about my love for design
				systems. When choosing which university course to undertake, I considered
				many, but all in all, what I wanted was something as strong as engineering,
				deep as architecture, and detailed as a medium-format photograph. The match
				was Communication Design at the Milan Polytechnic, which embodies each and
				every aspect of my idea of design: disciplined, fast paced, and with very
				strong foundations. This long-lasting learning journey, helped me understand
				what exactly I can deem to be keen on, in the infinite fields of design.
				Since the first steps—and of course it still hasn’t changed—I felt soundly
				bound to typography; it started I guess when I was asked to draw freehand
				the whole Bodoni and Neue Haas Grotesk alphabets, back in 2007, and that set
				off the basic instinct to become really accurate in seizing the right font,
				kerning and typographical grid for each and every task. I spent my teen
				years definetly not in a soccer field like most of my peers, but in front of
				a computer, learning the magic of code. I was getting aware of the digital
				world growing around me, and I started to translate all the layout rules
				drawn for printing, into digital objects. At this stage, I had a vast
				experience as a freelancer, spanning almost 8 years, so, after getting my
				bachelor in 2016, I took a year off working on projects more towards
				interaction design and for filling the gaps in my knowledge in order not to
				make a fool of myself if I wanted to enter the master of science in user
				experience and interaction design at my university (that still fell under
				the umbrella name of 'communication design' at the time). And so I enrolled,
				in february 2017, starting a whole new chapter. I gained my degree in april
				2019 with a thesis on 'User Experience design for land-drones remote
				driving', theme arose from my work experience during this time.
